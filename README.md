# opam-graph

Visualizes dependencies of "opam switch export --full --freeze" as dot or svg.

Note that this project is developed to serve https://builds.robur.coop/ and [builder-web](https://git.robur.coop/robur/builder-web/) and makes hard assumptions on the `--full` and `--freeze` flags passed to `opam switch export.
Please reach out to us at [Robur](https://robur.coop/Contact) if you have other needs.
